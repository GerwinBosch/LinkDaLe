# Assignment 1 : Explain Yourself

## Task:
In this assignment, students are asked to model and generate a Linked Data description of their 
companies, employees and goods/services they provide. 
This data will be used further on in the next assignment to perform a federated query in order to semantically enrich the 
original data with information from LOD.

### Required knowledge:
1.	The student knows the Linked Data principles and basic concepts such as triples and ontologies.
2.	The student knows how to analyse and model data. 
3.  The student has done first two Getting Started tutorials (Create Linked Data, Browse data).

### Goals:
1.	To learn how to model and analyse Linked Data structures using ontologies.
2.	To gain practical experience in conversion of source data into RDF.
4.	To learn the structure of the LOD cloud, and prominent ontologies.

### Assignment steps:
*	**List people in your group**. Make a list of people in you group. Provide a name, place of birth, age and a name of the company for every person in the group. These are your employees. 
*	**List goods/services your company provides**. Make a small list of things your company provides. This is your company description.
*	**Identify and model the relationships between items from two lists** (employees and company description). Use pencil and paper or any modelling software to draw the relations.
*	**Identify suitable terms (classes and properties)** for formalising the semantics of the identified relations. 
*	**Make a flat table** containing information about employees of your company, their names, place of birth, age, as well as services/goods the company provides. Save as .CSV file.
*   **Generate Linked Data** out of your data. Use [FOAF](http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/) and [GoodRelation](http://www.heppnetz.de/ontologies/goodrelations/v1.html) vocabularies to describe people, services and companies.
*   **Publish the results**
