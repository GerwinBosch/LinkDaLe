My First Linked Data
======

## In short
In this exercise you will learn how to create Linked Data representation of a simple table using ontologies.

**Comma-separated values (CSV)** is a widespread format for spreadsheets and simple databases. 
It uses plain text to store tabular data. Each record consists of one or more fields (columns), 
separated by commas. This format is not standardized, but the idea to separate values using an agreed 
upon delimiter is very simple. There are many variants including tab-separated values and 
space-separated values.
