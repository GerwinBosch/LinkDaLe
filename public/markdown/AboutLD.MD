# About Linked Data

## Linked data principles

Linked Data is a method of publishing structured data so that it can be linked and queried. 
It is built on the Semantic Web technology, and is driven by open standards set by the World 
Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The term was  invented by [Sir Tim Berners-Lee](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/566c/1c6bd366b4c9e07fc37eb372771690d5ba31.pdf) who also set [the four 
design rules]((https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html)) that are often used to define linked data. They are as follows:

1.	Use URIs as names for things
2.	Use HTTP URIs so that people can look up those names
3.	When someone looks up a URI, provide useful information, using the standards 
([RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/) and [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/))
4.	Include links to other URIs so that people can discover more things


Although these design rules look simple, it is far more complicated when diving into the world of linked 
data. The first two principles touch upon the use of HTTP URIs to name things. In the concept of the 
Semantic Web HTTP URIs are used as names for real-world objects and abstract concepts rather than as 
addresses for Web documents. The content of a data set is structured using a simple graph-based data 
model– the Resource Description Framework (RDF) . In RDF, a resource is described as a set of statements 
called triples or facts. A triple represents the basic structure of a sentence consisting of three parts, 
namely a subject, predicate and an object. 

These three parts can be expressed as URIs, but objects can also be literal. In general, the subject 
defines the described resource, the predicate, in the middle, shows what kind of relation exists between 
subject and object and object is another resource that has a relation with subject. There are several 
serializations of RDF, but XML-based is the most common format.

It consists of a subject expressed as a URI, predicate (also URI) and an object 
that can be either a liter or a URI. "/>

Figure 3 shows an example triple representing a simple fact that an object registered in the key 
registry of topography (BRT) with the number 117763908 is a church (kerk in Dutch). The first part 
of a triple, namely subject, is represented by a URI coined to hold the unique identification of 
the building. The URI resides in the BRT namespace and is shorten in the Figure to “brt”. 
Any registered attribute of this particular building will be linked to the subject via a predicate. 
In the Figure, the predicate (RDF namespace ) defines a type of the building, for instance, 
it is a church (kerk). A URI to define churches represents on objet of a triple. 
This URI originates from the BRT ontology (the same BRT namespace), a collection of 
formal concept definitions and relations. 

The example given in the Figure 3 demonstrates the use of the first three Linked Data design rules. 
One can notice that the result of implementation of those three rules corresponds to the four star 
data in the five star model. Moreover, implementation of the fourth design rule levels up the data 
to the fifth star.

The following example (see Figure 4) walks through the transformation steps to be taken to improve usability of an open dataset by enriching it with the structures and semantics. Let us imagine that the Dutch Kadaster registered a building of the Saint Catharine church erected in 1900 with a certain registration ID. In Figure 4, this is shown as free text. To make it machine-readable the data has to be structured, for example as a table. In this way, the free text is decomposed into smaller bits of information, which are written in a formal structure. The columns of the table contain semantically similar information. For example, it is assumed that the column with the name Registration ID hold only records with such ID, the opposite would be considered an error. 

However, even though the computers can read the tables, it is not possible for them to reason upon such structures. To enable reasoning, a formal representation of the concepts and relations used in the data should be decoupled from the data structure . The RDF data model together with ontologies provides means for capturing formal semantics independently from the data structure. As can be seen from the Figure, the table resulted in two triples one about the fact that the building is a church (kerk) and the other one says the year of constructions (bouwjaar means “year of construction” in Dutch). The URIs used in the triple explicitly define unique identifications for types and relations between data items. The Linked RDF, in the Figure, has an additional third triple that states that the registered building is the same building as described in DBpedia  (owl:sameAs is used). This makes the Linked Data linked.

## The LOD cloud

An attempt to provide an overview of Linked Open Data occurrences is made by the publication of the Linking Open Data Cloud diagram (see Figure 5). It portrays 1000+ datasets that are connected via Linked Open Data, although it does not mean that all datasets are open, license-wise. The metadata of each dataset is accessible via https://datahub.io .

To be included in the diagram the dataset needs to meet the following criteria: it must contain at least 1000 triples, it must connect to another dataset in the Cloud (the size of the circles corresponds to the number edges connected to each dataset), and must be accessible via an endpoint with resolvable web links (URIs). The LOD Cloud diagram provides a good entry point to a large number of datasets. The main prominent resources are DBpedia, a linked data extract of Wikipedia, and LinkedGeoData, an LD version of Openstreetmap . However, it does not necessarily enable the immediate meaningful connection between datasets. This needs a more careful evaluation of the semantics of the triples that are subject to such connection, possibly resulting in the semantic enrichment of them.
