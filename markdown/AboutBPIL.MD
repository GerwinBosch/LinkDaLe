# About BPIL

 The course consists of 3 practical assignments. Students will learn how to generate, query, and semantically enrich linked data.
 At the end of the course the generated data will be used in the final project.
 Students will be asked to perform a federated query from within the Mendix software.

 **It is suggested to do all the *Getting Started* tutorials before you start with the BPIL assignments.**
